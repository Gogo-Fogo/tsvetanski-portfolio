### From Customer Support to Development Mentor

### Shinobi Story
I began my journey with Shinobi Story as a customer service representative,
where I learned the intricacies of the game’s mechanics and community
interactions. Within a few months, my passion for the project led me to begin
learning development. In just over a year, I had not only mastered key
development skills but also started mentoring others in the team.

Within a year of learning game development, I began mentoring new developers on the
Shinobi Story team. I taught them the fundamentals of scripting, level design, and
gameplay mechanics, while also guiding them through the process of debugging and
improving game features. My focus was on ensuring they had the skills and confidence to
contribute meaningfully to the project, fostering a collaborative and supportive learning
environment.
