### Successful Breda Application

### Trash Been
With only one week to build a whole game from scratch, I had to create a very clear scope in the beggining and stick to
it. Not only was I able to complete my project on time and test run it with people from the internet, but I was also able
to update and improve its flaws.
In Trash Been, players jump and run through a polluted city, collecting trash bags to restore its beauty. As trash is
collected, the city transforms from grim to vibrant, and players gain speed and jump upgrades. Beware of enemy
“globs” that try to slow you down. The goal is to clean the city and overcome obstacles to bring back its color and life.

### QA and Testing
The most challenging aspect of this project was the programming, which required a deep understanding of game mechanics and
scripting, made more difficult by the limited timeframe. I overcame these hurdles by leveraging visual scripting, reverse engineering
templates, and seeking help from the Unity community. Despite the challenges, the most enjoyable part was watching others play the
game and seeing how they engaged with the world I created. Given more time, I would enhance the game’s replayability by adding
features like a leaderboard and procedural generation, as well as animating cinematics to elevate the storytelling experience.
