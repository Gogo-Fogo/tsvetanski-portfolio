### Building the Case for Georgi Tsvetanski: A Strategic Analysis
of a High-Potential Game Development Professional

### Section 1: Executive Summary: The Profile of a Modern Game
### Developer

This report establishes the case for Georgi Tsvetanski as an exemplary model of the
modern, "T-shaped" game development professional. His profile is distinguished by a
rare and valuable synthesis of deep technical and design proficiency—the vertical bar
of the 'T'—and a broad, proven aptitude for communication, multimedia production,
and team leadership—the horizontal bar. This combination of skills addresses a critical
need in the collaborative, multidisciplinary environment of contemporary game
development, where technical excellence must be paired with the ability to
communicate vision and work effectively within a team.1 The evidence presented
throughout this analysis demonstrates that Mr. Tsvetanski is not merely an aspiring
developer with academic knowledge; he is a proven practitioner with a uniquely
well-rounded skill set, making him a low-risk, high-potential candidate for his target
roles.
His key strengths are substantiated by a robust portfolio of practical work and
professional experience:
- ​ Proven Technical Versatility: His expertise is demonstrated across multiple solo

and team-based projects developed in the Unity engine. These projects span a
variety of genres, from first-person survival (Totally Bugged Out) and top-down
multiplayer (Cranky) to a mobile tactical RPG (Shogun: Flowers Fall in Blood),
showcasing a command of complex systems including AI behavior, universal
object physics, and UI/UX implementation.3 This breadth indicates an adaptability
that is highly valuable to studios working on diverse projects.
- ​ Agile Problem-Solving Under Pressure: The Trash Been project serves as a
definitive case study in rapid, full-cycle development. Tasked with creating a
complete game from scratch in one week for a university application, he

successfully managed the project's scope, overcame significant programming
challenges by leveraging visual scripting and community resources, and iterated
on the design based on direct QA feedback. This demonstrates an ability to
deliver a polished product under extreme constraints, a crucial capability in the
milestone-driven world of game production.3
- ​ Long-Term Project Dedication and Commercial Acumen: His multi-year
involvement with the indie title Shinobi Story illustrates a remarkable professional
trajectory. He progressed from a player-facing customer support role to a core
developer and eventually a mentor for new team members. His work on this
commercially successful project, which generated over $110,000 in revenue from
68,000 registered users, indicates not only reliability and a growth mindset but
also a practical understanding of the entire product lifecycle, from development
and monetization to community management.3
- ​ Exceptional Communication and Leadership: His profile is significantly
differentiated by elite communication skills, a competency that is critical but often
underdeveloped in technical candidates. His experience as the elected President
of the Undergraduate Communication Association, a published blog writer for The
Universities at Shady Grove, and a Digital and Visual Media Specialist for a
University of Maryland engineering department provides concrete evidence of his
ability to lead teams, manage projects, and create compelling content for specific
audiences.3
- ​ Proactive Industry Engagement: His initiative in seeking a volunteer QA Analyst
role for Shokuho, a complex total conversion mod for Mount & Blade II:
Bannerlord, signals a level of passion and self-motivation that significantly
de-risks him as a junior hire.3 This, combined with his extensive portfolio of
independent projects, shows a candidate who actively seeks challenges and
contributes to the gaming community beyond the requirements of his formal
education.
In conclusion, Georgi Tsvetanski's documented experience presents a compelling and
cohesive narrative. He is a candidate whose competencies in Game Design, Quality
Assurance, and Creative Development are not just claimed but are substantiated by a
rich body of evidence. His unique blend of technical skill, design thinking, and
communication prowess makes him exceptionally well-suited to thrive in the
collaborative and dynamic environments of top-tier game studios globally.

### Section 2: Foundational Pillars: An Interdisciplinary Education for

a Collaborative Industry

The modern game development industry is an inherently collaborative field, requiring
professionals who can effectively communicate across disciplines such as art,
programming, design, and marketing.1 A purely siloed skillset is no longer sufficient.
An analysis of Georgi Tsvetanski's academic journey reveals that his unique
educational trajectory is not a disparate collection of qualifications but a synergistic
foundation that has methodically built a professional perfectly suited for this
environment. His education has created a natural bridge between key development
departments, providing him with the language and perspective to understand and
facilitate the entire creative pipeline.

### Pillar 1: The Visual and Technical Foundation (Digital Animation)

Mr. Tsvetanski's academic journey began with an Associate's Degree in Digital
Animation from Montgomery College (2020-2023).3 This program provided him with
what he describes as a "strong foundation in 2D and 3D animation" utilizing
industry-standard software such as Autodesk Maya and the Adobe Creative Suite. The
curriculum was comprehensive, covering "digital media production, video editing,
motion graphics, and visual effects," as well as the fundamentals of storyboarding and
scriptwriting.3
This degree represents the artistic and technical grammar of visual development. It
explains the tangible quality of his project work, from the character animations he
designed for the game Cranky to the promotional videos and social media assets he
created for Shinobi Story and the UMD Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering (CPSE)
program.3 This education provides the "how it looks and moves" component of his
skillset. It is a core competency that ensures he can not only create visual assets but
also communicate effectively with art teams, understanding their workflows, tools,
and constraints. This practical knowledge of the art pipeline is a significant advantage
for any role in game development, from design to programming.4

Pillar 2: The Collaborative and Persuasive Framework (Communication & Media

### Studies)

Building upon his visual foundation, Mr. Tsvetanski earned a Bachelor's Degree in
Communication and Media Studies from the University of Maryland (2023-2024).3 This
program was not an ancillary pursuit but a strategic development of a crucial
professional skillset. The curriculum focused on "interpersonal communication,
persuasion, rhetoric, organizational communication, and public relations strategies".3
In his own words, his goal as a communication major was to learn how to "enhance
interactions and resolve conflicts using invitational rhetoric while maintaining
respect".3
This degree is perhaps his most significant differentiator. While many aspiring
developers possess technical or artistic talent, very few have a formal education in
the science of collaboration, persuasion, and organizational dynamics. This academic
framework directly underpins his documented success in leadership roles. It explains
his ability to rise to the presidency of the Undergraduate Communication Association
(UCA), where he was responsible for managing leadership teams and setting strategic
agendas.3 It informs his capacity to mentor new interns at UMD CPSE, equipping them
with the skills to contribute effectively.3 It is the theoretical basis for his practical work
as a Senior Community Manager for
Shinobi Story, where he cultivated a positive online environment and led a team of
community staff.3 This education provides the critical "middleware" that allows
different disciplines to connect, a skill repeatedly cited by industry sources as vital for
success in team-based game development.1

Pillar 3: The Systemic and Player-Centric Apex (Simulation & Game Design)

The final pillar of his education is his ongoing pursuit of a Bachelor's Degree in
Simulation and Game Design at the University of Baltimore, which he began in Spring
2025.3 This program, with its focus on "game design principles, user experience, and
interactive system design," serves to formalize and deepen the practical knowledge
he has already demonstrated in his extensive project portfolio.3
This degree represents the "how it plays and feels" component of game creation. It is
concerned with the core loops, mechanics, rulesets, and systems that combine to

create an engaging and responsive player experience. His commitment to this field of
study shows that he is dedicated to mastering the theoretical underpinnings of his
craft, moving beyond simple implementation to understand the why behind design
choices. This aligns perfectly with industry expectations for game designers, who
must be able to conceptualize, document, and balance complex interactive systems.2
The combination of these three distinct educational pillars creates a uniquely capable
professional. His academic path mirrors the very pipeline of game development itself:
from visual ideation and asset creation (Digital Animation), to the collaborative and
communicative processes required to build a product (Communication & Media
Studies), and finally to the core principles of interactive systems that define the player
experience (Simulation & Game Design). A developer with only a technical degree
might struggle to articulate their vision to the art team. A developer with only an art
degree may not grasp the technical constraints of the engine. Mr. Tsvetanski's
education systematically addresses these potential blind spots. His Communication
degree, in particular, acts as a force multiplier, transforming him from a specialist who
can speak only one "language" (art, code, or design) into a polyglot who can translate
between them. This suggests he possesses the foundational skills not only to
contribute to a single discipline but to understand and facilitate the crucial interaction
between disciplines—a core function of production and leadership roles within the
industry.

### Section 3: The Practitioner's Portfolio: Case Studies in
### Development, Design, and Leadership

While a strong educational foundation is essential, the modern game industry places
the highest premium on a portfolio of tangible work. A portfolio with playable demos,
clear write-ups, and documented results is the single most important asset for an
entry-level candidate, as it provides concrete proof of ability.6 Georgi Tsvetanski's
portfolio is both extensive and diverse, and this section moves from his theoretical
foundation to an analysis of his practical applications. Each project is deconstructed
as a piece of evidence, proving his capabilities and demonstrating a clear narrative of
growth, versatility, and skill acquisition.

3.1 Case Study: Shinobi Story (2019-2024) — The Crucible of a Professional

The most telling project in Mr. Tsvetanski's portfolio is his multi-year involvement with
Shinobi Story, an indie game development project at Pixel Bulb Studio.3 His journey
with this project, which spanned from December 2019 to April 2024, is a powerful
narrative of professional growth and commitment. He began as a customer service
representative, a role that immersed him in the intricacies of the game's mechanics
and community interactions from the player's perspective.3 Within months, his passion
led him to begin learning development, and in just over a year, he had not only
mastered key skills but was also mentoring new developers on the team.3 His roles
evolved to encompass Game Developer, Multimedia Specialist, and ultimately Senior
### Community Manager.3
As a developer, his responsibilities were significant. He conceptualized and executed
in-game content, including level design, NPC behavior, and complex boss fight
mechanics. He also managed database tasks, created queries, performed creature
rigging and animation, and ensured rigorous quality control throughout the
development process.3 As a multimedia specialist, he created a wide range of digital
content, including promotional videos, social media assets, and marketing materials to
enhance the game's online presence. One notable example is a marketing campaign
proposal he developed for the in-game cash shop, demonstrating a clear
understanding of visual merchandising, player retention, and monetization strategies.3
The project was a commercial success, achieving over 68,000 registered users and
generating $110,000 in total revenue, making it a profitable venture.3 This context is
crucial; his experience was not on a purely academic or hobbyist project but on a live
product with a real player base and financial stakes.
The "support-to-mentor" pipeline demonstrated in this project is the most powerful
narrative in his profile. Starting in customer support is not a minor detail; it is the origin
of his player-centric design philosophy. He was on the front lines, internalizing user
feedback, pain points, and desires. This experience is invaluable for any QA or Game
Design role, where a deep understanding of the end-user is paramount.9 His rapid and
self-directed transition to developer and then mentor demonstrates exceptional
learning velocity and initiative. He did not wait to be assigned training; he learned the
necessary skills and then immediately began to add further value by teaching others,
as evidenced by the developer tutorial video he created to teach new team members
how to use the database and work with smart NPC behavior.3 This trajectory proves he

possesses three critical soft skills:
empathy (gained from player support), autodidacticism (from self-teaching
development), and leadership (from mentoring others).
Shinobi Story is not just a project on a resume; it is a multi-year apprenticeship that
has de-risked him as a junior hire. He has proven he can function effectively in a team,
contribute meaningfully to a live and profitable product, handle the pressure of
deadlines, grow his skills independently, and lead others. He has already performed
the duties of a junior developer, a community manager, and a marketing specialist,
making him a uniquely experienced candidate.

3.2 Case Study: Trash Been — Agile Development and Iterative Problem-Solving

As part of his successful application to the Game Design track at Breda University of
Applied Sciences, Mr. Tsvetanski developed Trash Been, an original game project built
from scratch in a single week.3 In the game, players navigate a polluted, grayscale city,
collecting trash to restore its color and vibrancy while gaining speed and jump
upgrades and avoiding enemy "globs".3 This project serves as a perfect,
self-contained microcosm of the entire game development cycle and a testament to
his ability to perform under intense pressure.
Recognizing the severe time constraint, he established a clear and manageable scope
from the outset and adhered to it, a crucial project management skill.3 He identified
programming as the most challenging aspect, given the timeframe. His approach to
this hurdle demonstrates a mature and pragmatic problem-solving methodology: he
leveraged visual scripting to accelerate development, reverse-engineered templates
to implement functionalities efficiently, and sought help from the Unity community to
overcome specific obstacles.3 This shows a lack of ego and a focus on results, which
are essential traits for collaborative work.
Crucially, the project did not end at delivery. Mr. Tsvetanski conducted QA testing with
players from the internet and then iterated on the game to improve its flaws.3 The
documentation provides specific, concrete examples of this process. When a
playtester found the initial movement slow and the jump unsatisfying, he doubled the
initial speed and jump power to make them more "tolerable".3 When another tester
discovered a glitch that allowed them to jump past a "zone gate" and fly into the air,

he diagnosed the problem and fixed it by adding new collision boundaries, which also
resolved the secondary glitch.3
This project is the perfect story to articulate using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action,
Result) method in an interview. It demonstrates his ability to deliver a functional,
polished, and enjoyable product under extreme time pressure. For any hiring manager
concerned about a junior candidate's ability to manage their time and ship a product,
Trash Been provides a compelling and evidence-based counterargument. It is proof of
his analytical and debugging skills and showcases a developer with an innate QA
mindset, who understands that building the game is only part of the process; testing
and refining it based on user feedback is what leads to quality.5

3.3 Case Study: The Unity Creations Suite — A Laboratory of Versatility

Mr. Tsvetanski's portfolio includes a diverse suite of "Unity Creations," a collection of
solo and team projects that function as his personal research and development
department.3 This collection showcases his technical breadth and his intrinsic
motivation to explore different genres and mechanics, demonstrating an adaptability
that makes him valuable to a wide range of studios.
### The projects include:
- ​ Totally Bugged Out: A solo-developed, first-person bug survival game set in a

Balkan house. This project highlights his ability to implement complex systems,
featuring a "universal throw system" for object interaction and "creepy-crawly AI
that climbs walls and ceilings".3
- ​ Cranky (Game Jam 2024): A chaotic, top-down, split-screen multiplayer game
made in one week for the Global Game Jam. In this team project, he served as
Lead Animator and Co-Designer, shaping the "goofy, frantic gameplay".3
- ​ Cranky: The Squirrel Annihilator: A reimagined solo version of the game jam
concept, transformed into a first-person "dog chase game." This project
demonstrates his commitment to iteration and refinement, featuring a unique
control scheme (L1/R1 inputs simulating paw rhythm), reactive squirrel and rooster
### AI, a full UI, and WebGL support for browser-based play.3
- ​ Shogun: Flowers Fall in Blood: A solo-developed prototype for a mobile tactical
RPG inspired by games like Naruto Blazing. This project shows his awareness of
mobile-specific design patterns, as it was built with a full progression system,

enemy AI, and a gacha simulation mechanic.3
This suite of projects proves he is not a one-trick pony. He has actively experimented
with first-person versus top-down perspectives, complex AI behaviors (pathfinding on
non-standard surfaces, reactive logic), and different platform considerations (PC,
WebGL, mobile). The evolution of Cranky from a jam prototype into a more polished
solo project demonstrates a self-directed iterative process. Furthermore, the creation
of a mobile tactical RPG like Shogun shows that he pays attention to market trends
and understands different business models within the industry. A hiring manager sees
this collection not just as a series of demos, but as evidence of a candidate who will
continuously grow, learn, and add new skills to the team without requiring constant
external prompting. This directly addresses the industry's need for developers who
engage in "continuous learning and adaptation".2

3.4 Case Study: Conceptual Design (The Last Paycheck & The Signal) — The Mind
of a Designer

Beyond his coded projects, Mr. Tsvetanski's portfolio includes works of pure design,
demonstrating his ability to conceptualize and document complex systems and
narratives. This is the core work of a Game Designer and showcases a holistic
understanding of game creation that transcends implementation.2
- ​ The Last Paycheck: This project is a full Game Design Document (GDD) for a

narrative-driven simulation exploring mature and socially relevant themes of
poverty, survival, and emotional engagement in a dystopian America.3 The design
focuses on managing unstable jobs and unpredictable inflation while caring for a
child, indicating a desire to use games to explore serious, emotionally resonant
topics. This displays a level of creative maturity that goes beyond simple
mechanics.
- ​ The Signal: This is a team-designed sci-fi exploration board game. As part of the
team, Mr. Tsvetanski contributed to design, systems, lore writing, and visual
assets.3 The game features complex, interconnected systems, including
procedural map generation, enemy behavior systems, player class customization,
and both cooperative and competitive victory paths.3
These projects are the ultimate proof of his qualification for a Game Design role. They
demonstrate that he can handle the abstract, conceptual phase of development,

which is often a significant hurdle for purely technical applicants. He has proven his
ability to think systemically, balancing narrative, mechanics, and player experience.
The GDD for The Last Paycheck and his systems work on The Signal show that he can
generate the detailed blueprint from which other developers would build, marking him
as a candidate with the potential for design leadership.

an entry-level candidate.18
- ​ Berlin, Germany: A dynamic and creative hub with a healthy mix of major AAA
studios (Ubisoft, Wargaming), established mid-size developers (Klang Games,
Yager), and innovative indies (Elysium Game Studio).21 The opportunities here
are diverse. Elysium Game Studio, for example, is explicitly looking for talent with
Unreal Engine experience and has open roles for QA Testers.22 GAMOMAT has
posted openings for Junior Software Engineers.24 This makes Berlin a prime
target, particularly for his QA and developer skill sets.
- ​ Amsterdam, Netherlands: Home to AAA powerhouse Guerrilla Games (Horizon
series), Amsterdam also has a strong VR and mobile scene with studios like
Vertigo Games and CoolGames.25 Guerrilla's focus on high-fidelity, cinematic
experiences aligns perfectly with Mr. Tsvetanski's background in Digital Animation
and multimedia production. Vertigo Games, a leader in VR, is actively hiring for
designers and programmers, while the city's strong indie developer community
offers many opportunities for a versatile developer with Unity skills.28
- ​ Barcelona, Spain: A prominent hub for mobile gaming, with major studios like
Gameloft, Socialpoint (a Zynga/Take-Two company), and Scopely, as well as
offices for Ubisoft and local developers like Novarama.30 His experience
designing a mobile RPG prototype (​
Shogun), complete with gacha mechanics, is directly applicable to the core
business of these mobile-focused studios. Job boards show that companies like
Gameloft and Scopely are actively hiring for QA Testers and Game Designers,
making Barcelona a strong strategic target, especially for roles related to mobile
game development.30

5.3 The U.S. Internship Pathway

Mr. Tsvetanski has expressed an interest in "unpaid internships or volunteer
opportunities in the U.S." to continue building experience.3 While this willingness
demonstrates immense passion and drive, a strategic pivot is recommended.
The U.S. game industry standard, particularly at reputable, established studios, is for
paid internships.34 Unpaid internships at for-profit companies are often legally
questionable and may not provide the structured mentorship and valuable experience
of a formal program.34 More importantly, Mr. Tsvetanski's profile is far stronger than
that of a typical undergraduate applicant. With multiple solo projects, experience on a
shipped commercial title, and significant leadership roles, he is a highly competitive
candidate for the top-tier, paid summer internship programs offered by major
publishers like Electronic Arts, Activision, Epic Games, and Nintendo.35 Pursuing
unpaid work would be undervaluing his demonstrated capabilities and could lead him
toward less structured and less beneficial opportunities.
An internship at a major U.S. studio should be viewed as the ultimate extended
interview. It is a "trial period" where the company can assess a candidate's skills, work
ethic, and cultural fit before extending a full-time offer.37 The key to converting an
internship into a full-time role is to go beyond the assigned tasks: take initiative, ask
insightful questions, demonstrate ownership over one's work, and make a lasting
contribution to the team.38 Mr. Tsvetanski's entire history of proactive work—from
self-teaching development to seeking out volunteer roles—suggests he is naturally
inclined to exhibit these exact behaviors.
Therefore, the strategic recommendation is to pivot his U.S. search away from
unpaid/volunteer roles and toward the formal, paid summer internship programs at
major U.S. developers and publishers. His application should be framed not as a
student seeking a learning opportunity, but as a high-potential developer ready to
contribute meaningful work from day one, as evidenced by his extensive and
impressive portfolio.

### Section 6: Concluding Analysis and Strategic Recommendations

The body of evidence presented in this report constructs a compelling case for Georgi
Tsvetanski as a high-potential, low-risk candidate for the global game development
industry. His profile demonstrates a rare and valuable convergence of technical skill,
creative design sense, proven leadership, and exceptional communication ability. His
journey from a player support role to a developer and mentor on a profitable indie
game, coupled with a diverse portfolio of solo projects and a strong, interdisciplinary
academic foundation, sets him apart from typical entry-level applicants. He is not just
qualified for a junior role; he is primed for rapid growth and has demonstrated the raw
materials for future leadership. His extensive practical experience and proactive
engagement significantly mitigate the risks that hiring managers typically associate
with junior hires.
To translate this potential into tangible career opportunities, the following strategic
recommendations are provided.

### Actionable Strategic Recommendations
1.​ Portfolio and Resume Curation: A one-size-fits-all application is insufficient. It

is recommended to create three distinct versions of his resume and portfolio,
each meticulously tailored to one of his three primary target roles. This approach
will ensure that the most relevant skills and experiences are immediately visible to
recruiters for each specific position.
○​ For Game Design roles: The application should lead with his conceptual
work. The The Last Paycheck GDD should be a centerpiece, followed by the
### Shogun tactical RPG prototype and a detailed breakdown of the systems
design work (NPC behavior, boss mechanics) he performed on Shinobi Story.
### His formal education in Simulation & Game Design should be prominently
featured.
○​ For QA roles: The application must highlight his direct QA experience. His
current role with the Shokuho Mod Team should be the leading item, detailing
his responsibilities in structured testing, bug reporting, and performance
analysis. The case study of identifying and fixing bugs in Trash Been should
be used as a practical example of his problem-solving process.
○​ For Creative Development roles: The application narrative should focus on
his multimedia and communication skills. His professional experience as a

Digital and Visual Media Specialist for UMD CPSE, supported by the video
trailers and marketing materials he created for Shinobi Story and his extensive
work as a blog writer, should be at the forefront.
2.​ Narrative Articulation for Interviews: Interviews are performances where
storytelling is key. Mr. Tsvetanski should prepare to articulate the compelling
narratives behind his key projects. He should practice framing his experiences
using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to provide clear, concise,
and impactful answers. Specifically, he should master the telling of two key
stories:
○​ The "Support-to-Mentor" journey of Shinobi Story, emphasizing his growth,
player empathy, and leadership.
○​ The "Agile Problem-Solving" case study of Trash Been, highlighting his ability
to deliver a quality product under extreme pressure.
3.​ Strategic Skill Enhancement: To maximize his competitiveness for dedicated QA
roles, particularly at larger studios, it is strongly recommended that he begin
studying for the ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board)
Foundation Level certification. This certification is a globally recognized
industry standard that would formalize his practical QA knowledge and make his
resume stand out to QA hiring managers.12
4.​ Targeted Networking: A passive job search is not enough. A proactive
networking strategy is essential.
○​ He should leverage LinkedIn to identify and connect with recruiters and
discipline leads (e.g., "Lead Game Designer," "QA Manager," "Art Director") at
the specific target studios identified in the "Target City Opportunity
Snapshot" table.
○​ When sending connection requests or messages, he should craft
personalized notes that demonstrate genuine interest and research. A generic
message is easily ignored. A powerful approach is to reference a specific
game the studio has made and connect it to a relevant project of his own. For
example: "As a long-time player of Paradox's grand strategy games, my
experience designing systems for my tactical RPG prototype Shogun and
modding Mount & Blade has given me a deep appreciation for the complex,
emergent gameplay your team creates."
5.​ Refined U.S. Internship Strategy: As detailed in the previous section, the focus
of his U.S. job search should be strategically pivoted.
○​ He should cease searching for unpaid or volunteer roles and focus exclusively
on the paid summer internship programs at major U.S. studios (e.g., Epic
### Games, Activision, EA, Ubisoft, Nintendo).35
○​ He must be mindful of the application cycle. These programs typically open

for applications in the fall (September-November) for the following summer.35
He should prepare his tailored application materials well in advance of these
windows.
○​ His application narrative should be framed around the value he can add to the
studio from day one, not just what he hopes to learn. His extensive portfolio is
the evidence that supports this confident positioning.
