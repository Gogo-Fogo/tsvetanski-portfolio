### Strategic Career Trajectories in Immersive Game &
XR Design (2025–2035)
1. High-Paying, AI-Resilient Roles in Immersive Design
Below is an updated list of high-value career paths related to VR/AR game design, XR systems, interaction
design, narrative design, and gameplay systems. These roles emphasize creative systems thinking, user
experience, and design – areas requiring human insight and thus resilient to AI automation 1 2 . Each
role is aligned with the profile (design-focused, light coding, no 3D asset artist roles) and includes current
salary ranges, future outlook, needed qualifications, key sectors, and an AI impact analysis.
1. XR Interaction Designer / Spatial UX Designer – Designs intuitive 3D user interfaces and interactions
for VR/AR experiences. This role centers on how users navigate and interact in immersive
environments, an area well-suited to the user's UX and Unity prototyping skills. It involves creating
spatial UI layouts, ergonomic controls (e.g. gesture, gaze, voice input), and ensuring comfort
(minimizing VR motion sickness) 3 4 . Alignment: The user's background in multimedia
storytelling and game UX fits well, as XR interaction design blends creative narrative elements with
user-centered interface design.
2. Salary (2025 & Beyond): XR-focused UX designers are highly compensated, especially at senior
levels. In the US, experienced immersive UX designers earn around $100k–$150k annually, with top
AR/VR design roles at major tech firms reaching $150k–$220k+ in high-cost hubs 5 6 . (For
instance, Google listed Senior Interaction Designer roles in AR with a $151k–$222k salary range 6 7 .)
European salaries are lower on average – typically €55k–€110k for XR UI/UX designers in leading
markets like London, Berlin, Amsterdam 8 9 . (Major EU hubs have a range roughly €55k on the
low end up to €100k+ for senior talent.) By 2030, these figures are expected to rise further with XR’s
growth (the XR industry is projected to exceed $100B by 2030 10 ), potentially boosting salaries ~10–
20%+ as demand for immersive UX experts outpaces supply.
3. Education & Portfolio: A bachelor’s plus a strong portfolio of XR interface prototypes is key.
Many job postings favor candidates with formal HCI or design education; a Master’s in Interaction
Design or HCI (like UBalt’s program) is a valuable differentiator 11 12 . To stand out, the portfolio
should showcase spatial UX case studies – for example, designing an AR heads-up display or VR
menu system – complete with user research insights and iterations. Detailing the process (user
needs, sketches, prototypes, and testing results) is crucial 13 14 . Tip: Include interactive demos
(host on WebXR or Itch.io) and short video walkthroughs of the UX to demonstrate usability in 3D
15 .
4. Hiring Sectors: This role is in demand across gaming studios (VR/AR game development), Big Tech
XR teams (e.g. Meta Reality Labs, Apple Vision Pro, Microsoft HoloLens), and enterprise XR (e.g.
firms building training simulators, medical or educational AR apps). The XR boom is no longer
confined to gaming – industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and education are heavily investing
in AR/VR 16 17 , so immersive UX designers find opportunities in a wide array of sectors. Portability

1

is high: skills in designing effective XR experiences apply to a game studio or a MedTech startup alike
18
19 .
5. AI Augmentation vs. Replacement: Augmentation (Low replacement risk). AI is a powerful copilot for this role, but not a substitute for human-centered design. Generative AI can assist with
rapid prototyping – e.g. transforming sketches into UI layouts or autocompleting Unity UI code –
accelerating the workflow for a non-programmer 20 21 . Tools like Uizard or Galileo AI can draft
interface mockups from text, and code assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) help implement
interactions via scripting 20 22 . AI can also analyze UX research data (summarizing user test
feedback or spotting UX pain points) to inform design tweaks 23 . However, creative and empathic
skills remain irreplaceable: deciding how an interaction should feel, anticipating human emotions
and comfort, and innovating entirely new interface paradigms require a human designer’s vision 24
25 . AI lacks the lived experience and empathy to design for human joy or safety in XR – it can
generate options, but the designer must curate and refine them. In practice, AI frees the XR UX
designer from drudge work (coding UI boilerplate, parsing research data) so they can focus on
higher-level experience design. The role’s emphasis on human factors and novel problem-solving
makes it highly resilient to automation.
6. Game UX Designer & User Researcher – Ensures video games (including VR/AR games) are intuitive,
engaging, and player-friendly. This role (“the Player’s Advocate”) combines interaction design with
behavioral research, focusing on both in-game interface design and around-game systems (menus,
lobbies, inventories) 26 27 . It aligns with the user’s strengths in game UX, QA testing, and modding
– all about refining gameplay feel and usability. A Game UX Designer works to remove friction from
gameplay, design clear HUDs and control schemes, and conduct playtests to iterate on the player
experience. They often also act as UX Researchers for games, running usability tests, analyzing
player behavior data, and championing player needs in the development process.
7. Salary (2025 & Outlook): Game UX design is a robustly compensated niche, especially as games
become “live services” needing ongoing UX optimization. The US average for Game UX/UI Designers
is around $100k–$110k 28 , but major hubs command a premium. In New York City, for example, a
Game UI/UX Designer averages ~$163k with top quartile near $170k 28 29 . (This is significantly
higher than generic UX roles in the same city 30 5 , reflecting specialized demand.) Other gaming
hubs like Seattle, Los Angeles, Austin see senior game UX salaries in the $120k+ range, and AAA
studios (Activision, Sony, etc.) often pay well into six figures for lead UX roles. In Europe, game UX
salaries vary – £40k–£65k in the UK for experienced designers (senior roles in London topping ~£65k
31 ), and roughly €50k–€80k in cities like Montreal, Berlin or Paris depending on studio and
experience. By 2030, expect incremental growth; as games continue to rely on excellent UX for
player retention and monetization, veteran Game UX designers could see salaries approach $180k+
in top markets, with EU roles possibly reaching €90k+. Notably, the New York gaming sector is
booming (7,900 jobs across 380 studios by 2025) with strong government support 32 33 ,
suggesting sustained salary growth in such hubs.
8. Education & Portfolio: A background in game design or HCI is ideal. The user’s B.S. in Game &
Simulation covers game design fundamentals; adding a Master’s (e.g. in Interaction Design) would
supply advanced UX research training – a strong combo for this role 11 34 . Portfolio is critical:
include case studies of game interface designs and the research behind them. For example, the
portfolio might show a redesign of a game HUD or VR game tutorial, with before-and-after usability
metrics or player feedback surveys. Emphasize iterative design: user flow diagrams, wireframes,

2

interactive prototypes built in Unity/Unreal UMG, and results from playtesting sessions (e.g. “reduced
player error rate by X% after UI changes”). Hiring managers want to see evidence of problem-solving
and player empathy, not just flashy visuals 35 36 . Since this role straddles design and research,
highlighting UX research methods (like heuristic evaluations, A/B tests, analytics) used in your
projects will strengthen your candidacy. Any modding projects where you improved a game’s UI or a
QA project where you identified UX issues can serve as portfolio pieces demonstrating this skill set.
9. Hiring Studios/Sectors: Primarily video game studios – ranging from AAA console/PC developers
to mobile and VR game companies. Studios like Riot Games, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, etc., all
employ UX designers to refine game interfaces and player flows. Even indie game companies are
increasingly investing in UX research to compete. Additionally, XR product companies (e.g. Oculus/
Meta, HTC Vive) hire game UX specialists to design system UI and game-like experiences on their
platforms. Some non-game industries with gamified products (e.g. an ed-tech VR training app) also
seek game UX expertise to make interfaces engaging. Geographically, roles cluster in game dev hubs
(San Francisco Bay, Seattle, LA, Austin, NYC, Montreal, Stockholm, etc.), but remote roles are rising.
Notably, New York’s push to be a global game hub – through tax credits and new game incubators –
makes it a promising locale for UX careers 33 37 .
10. AI Impact – Augmentation: Low replacement risk, high augmentation. AI tools are increasingly
used in the game UX field to improve design and research efficiency, but they won’t replace the
designer’s holistic understanding of player psychology. For instance, AI-driven analytics (built into
platforms like Unity Analytics or third-party tools) can automatically flag points where players
struggle, and large language models can summarize open-ended player feedback from surveys or
reviews 23 . AI can even generate UI layout suggestions or assist in creating tutorial text. As of 2024,
~49% of game developers were already in teams using generative AI in some capacity 38 – often for
tasks like content generation or coding – a trend that will only grow. A Game UX Designer can
leverage this by using AI to simulate user behavior (e.g. bots that navigate a UI to test its flow) or to
generate variant UI designs to A/B test. Narrative designers on the team might use AI to draft
tutorial dialogue which the UX designer then refines. Crucially, strategic UX decisions –
understanding player emotions, balancing ease-of-use vs. challenge, and maintaining a fun
factor – remain human judgments. AI can crunch numbers on where players drop off or even
propose a fix (“make this button bigger”), but deciding how to seamlessly integrate game mechanics
with interface and story is an art rooted in human creativity. Thus, AI will serve as a research
assistant and rapid prototyper, while the human designer remains the ultimate arbiter of player
experience. The role is future-proof so long as the designer embraces AI for routine tasks and
focuses on the creative and empathic aspects that define player satisfaction.
11. Immersive Gameplay Systems Designer – Designs and balances the core gameplay mechanics and
rule systems in immersive games (VR, AR, etc.). This “architect of the fun” defines how the game works
under the hood – from combat mechanics and physics to progression systems and economies 39
40 . In a VR context, they adapt game design principles to new inputs and spatial play: e.g. how a
real-life swing translates to in-game damage, or how to handle movement and collision in 360°
space 41 . This role aligns with the user’s interest in systems design and prototyping. It is more
technical than pure design roles (involves logic, mathematics, and some scripting), but “light
scripting is okay” for the user – indeed, proficiency in visual scripting (Unity C# scripts or Unreal
Blueprints) is often required to prototype systems 42 . The user’s modding experience is a plus here,
as modders often tweak game systems and understand balancing.

3

12. Salary (2025 & Future): Gameplay Systems Designers are highly valued because they directly
influence a game’s success and monetization. While data specific to “XR Systems Designer” is scarce,
we can extrapolate from senior game designer and technical designer salaries. In the US, a general
Game Designer in top markets like NYC averages ~$163,500 43 44 . A senior technical designer
or systems designer can command $140k–$180k+ at well-funded studios 45 46 . In fact, systems
design is often a senior role filled by designers with several years experience; thus compensation
skews high. For example, one analysis put a senior Gameplay Systems Designer in the $150k range
in NYC, given technical artists can exceed $200k and game designers ~$163k 45 46 . By 2030, as
immersive games proliferate, exceptional systems designers could see offers above $200k
(particularly in markets with lots of competition for talent). In Europe, salaries are more modest: a
systems/game designer in, say, France or UK might see €50k–€80k ($55k–$90k) at mid-levels, up to
~€100k for lead roles at major studios. (Many UK senior game designers max out around £60–65k
31 , though cities like Stockholm or Helsinki at top companies could offer higher with bonuses.) The
key is that wherever games-as-a-service thrive, companies are willing to pay a premium for the
designers who keep players engaged (retention = revenue) 47 .
13. Required Skills & Portfolio: This role requires a blend of analytical design and technical skill. A
strong grasp of game design theory (player psychology, feedback loops, reward systems) is needed
48
49 . The user’s game design studies will help, but they should further develop skills in scripting
and math (e.g. comfortable tweaking formulas for damage, drop rates, etc.). A formal degree isn’t
strictly required if one has a great track record, but a degree in Game Design or Computer Science
plus a portfolio will open doors. (Many systems designers start as level designers or gameplay
programmers and move up 50 , so hands-on experience is critical.) The portfolio should feature
prototypes or mods demonstrating interesting mechanics or systems: for example, a Unity
prototype of a VR puzzle game with a novel physics mechanic, or documentation of a rebalanced
economy mod for an existing game. Include spreadsheets or charts showing how you balanced
that system – employers love to see the designer’s process for achieving game balance 14 51 . If the
user completes a capstone project or thesis, choosing a systems-driven project (like developing a
small VR game with leveling and scoring systems and reporting on the design iterations) would be
ideal.
14. Hiring Sectors: Predominantly game development studios – especially those making complex or
long-term engagement games (RPGs, MMOs, VR worlds, etc.). VR game studios (like those creating
MMORPGs in VR or extensive simulation games) need systems designers to tailor traditional
gameplay to VR constraints. Additionally, any company building immersive simulations (military
training sims, educational VR with gamified progression) will value this skill set. While the games
industry can be volatile, the diversification of XR into enterprise means systems designers could
also find roles in non-traditional areas, e.g. designing the rules of a corporate VR training “game” or
an AR fitness app’s reward system 52 17 . Studios in the U.S. (California, Texas, East Coast) and
Canada (Montreal, Vancouver) are hotspots. With the user’s EU citizenship, they might consider
studios like Ubisoft (France/Sweden), CD Projekt (Poland) or Remedy (Finland) – EU studios where
systemic design in games is key.
15. AI Augmentation vs. Replacement: Augmentation (Moderate risk if not upskilled). AI can assist
in certain technical tasks here, but creative systems design remains a human-led activity. On one
hand, AI-driven tools can help run thousands of simulations to auto-balance a game system – for
example, using AI agents to play through levels and find dominant strategies or exploits, giving the
designer data on what to tweak. AI analytics can also predict how changes might affect player
retention. Some AI (like procedural content generation algorithms) might even suggest new

4

mechanics or generate procedural level layouts tied to the systems. The designer should leverage
these: e.g. using a machine learning model to optimize a difficulty curve or employing generative AI
to brainstorm variants of a game rule. AI can also handle tedious work like adjusting hundreds of
weapon stats and finding an optimal balance faster than manual trial-and-error. However, the core
of systems design – deciding the rules of engagement and ensuring they produce fun – is
creative and context-specific. AI cannot truly understand “fun” or the subtle interplay of mechanics
and player emotion; it can only optimize given parameters. Moreover, introducing AI-designed
mechanics blindly could break a game’s vision or feel. Therefore, an astute systems designer will use
AI as a helper for iteration (to crunch numbers or generate alternatives) but will stay firmly in
control of the design direction. Notably, AI opens new horizons for this role: e.g. incorporating
generative AI NPC behavior as part of the game’s systems (as some games now use AI for more
lifelike NPC dialogue). The user should become comfortable integrating AI components into game
systems (for instance, using Inworld AI to give NPCs dynamic conversations 53 as part of the
gameplay). Those who can orchestrate AI-driven game systems will be in especially high demand
(and safe from replacement, since they operate at a meta-level, directing AI rather than being
replaced by it). In summary, while parts of balancing can be automated, the visionary “rule-maker”
aspect is safe – making this a future-proof path if one continuously adapts by mastering new AIassisted design tools.
16. Immersive Narrative Designer / Story Systems Designer – Crafts the story, dialogue, and narrative
systems of immersive experiences (VR/AR games, interactive stories, metaverse worlds). This role is the
evolution of the traditional game writer into the XR space, where storytelling extends beyond linear
scripts into spatial and interactive dimensions. It aligns with the user's strength in multimedia
storytelling while avoiding rote asset creation. Immersive Narrative Designers design how a story
unfolds in response to player actions, often working with branching storylines, environmental
storytelling (placing narrative clues in a VR environment), and dynamic content generation. They also
often design or utilize narrative systems – e.g. dialogue trees, choice-consequence logic, or AIdriven storytelling tools – making it a hybrid of creative writing and systems design. The user’s
background in Communication and Animation (understanding how to convey story and emotion
visually) and modding (perhaps having tweaked game stories or questlines) provides a good
foundation for this path.
17. Salary (2025 & Future): Narrative design in games is a bit less lavishly paid than technical design
roles, but senior narrative designers at top studios are still well-compensated. In 2025, the average
Narrative Designer in the US makes around $85k–$95k 54 , with senior levels crossing into the low
six figures (~$105k) 54 . Some sources show averages ~$92k 55 . At big-name companies (e.g. AAA
studios or companies like Amazon Games), narrative designers can earn in the low $100k’s; for
instance, Glassdoor estimates Senior Narrative Designer around $107k total in the US 54 . In the EU,
narrative designers/writers see lower figures – often €40k–€70k, depending on country and
experience (writing roles tend to have a wide range, with countries like UK on the lower end £30–
£50k for many, while a few high-end positions in, say, Germany or Sweden might approach €80k). By
2030, these salaries will likely grow modestly. However, one big shift is the media expansion of XR –
narrative designers might find new lucrative opportunities writing interactive stories for VR
entertainment, VR cinema, or metaverse platforms. Big tech companies entering the metaverse
could offer higher salaries (comparable to product designers) for narrative experts who can shape
engaging story-driven content in XR. There are already instances of AR/VR content designers at large

5

firms making $120k+. Additionally, if the narrative designer has AI-related skills (see below), they
could position themselves in a cutting-edge niche commanding a premium.
18. Role Fit & Requirements: While usually not requiring as much programming as a gameplay
designer, an immersive narrative designer should be comfortable with scripted logic and tools (e.g.
using node-based scripting in a dialogue editor like Ink or Fungus, or Unreal’s Blueprint to trigger
story events). The user’s “light scripting okay” stance fits – it’s more about logical thinking than
advanced algorithms. A degree in writing, literature, or game design helps, but what truly matters is
writing skill + design thinking. The portfolio for this role could include: writing samples (game
dialogue, interactive script excerpts), plus a designed narrative experience – for example, a small
prototype of a VR story game or a Twine interactive fiction that demonstrates branching choices. In
XR, demonstrating you understand spatial storytelling is key: consider building a short Unity VR
scene where the narrative is conveyed through the environment (object placement, character
voiceover triggered by proximity, etc.). Document how you integrated story with player agency. Any
project where you worked with AI narrative tools (like using AI to generate NPC dialogue variations)
would be a bonus, showing you can direct AI creatively.
19. Hiring Sectors: Game development studios (especially those focused on narrative-driven games,
RPGs, open-world games) are the main employers. For XR specifically, studios creating narrative VR
experiences (e.g. Tender Claws, Schell Games, or VR divisions of bigger studios) hire narrative
designers. There’s also a growing field of immersive media – VR films, interactive theater in VR, and
themed attractions using AR/VR – which need storytellers who understand interactive narrative. Even
sectors like education or healthcare sometimes seek narrative designers for scenario-based training
apps (crafting the story of a medical simulation, for instance). As the “metaverse” evolves, social VR
platforms (like Horizon Worlds, VRChat) might engage narrative designers to create story-driven
content and live events. The user’s openness to global relocation is a strength: narrative design jobs
can be found in narrative hubs like Montreal, Poland (many RPG studios), Sweden, the US West
Coast, etc. Some narrative designers also freelance or contract per project (but the user prefers fulltime employment, which is available albeit competitive).
20. AI Augmentation vs. Replacement: Collaboration (Medium risk if solely a writer). Narrative
design is an area where AI has made big strides in content generation (e.g. large language models
can now draft dialogues, lore, even quest descriptions). This means pure game writers could see
some tasks automated. However, the strategic narrative designer role – who designs the narrative
arcs and integrates them into gameplay – remains critical. AI should be embraced as a creative
partner: for instance, using GPT-based tools to generate first-draft dialogue, lore ideas, or
alternate story branches rapidly. The designer can prompt an AI to suggest 10 variants of a
character’s line or to brainstorm possible outcomes of a player choice, vastly speeding up iteration.
Tools like Inworld AI allow designers to create AI-driven NPCs that converse unscripted with players;
an immersive narrative designer would craft the characters’ backstories and prompt engineering
constraints, letting the AI fill in actual dialogue live 53 . In this scenario, the designer’s job resembles
a “dialogue director”, shaping AI behavior rather than writing every line. Additionally, AI voice
synthesis (e.g. ElevenLabs) can provide instant voice-over for scripted lines 53 , enabling rapid
prototyping of voiced story scenes without hiring actors for early testing. Importantly, someone still
needs to define the story’s vision, emotional beats, and ensure coherence – AI might generate lots of
text, but it can’t reliably ensure a satisfying narrative arc or thematic consistency. The narrative
designer will spend more time curating and editing AI-generated content, and less time on rote
writing. Those who upskill in AI tools will thrive: for example, learning to fine-tune AI narrative
systems (perhaps training a model on your game’s lore so it stays consistent) becomes a valuable

6

skill. Overall, while AI can automate writing at the micro level, it augments the narrative designer
by offering a sandbox of ideas and instant content to shape. The human remains the storyteller-inchief, safeguarding quality and meaning – a creative function that is hard to replace. The key to
resilience here is embracing AI for efficiency (not seeing it as a threat) and focusing on the higherorder design of narrative experiences that AI on its own would lack the intent to create.
21. Technical Designer / XR Prototyping Specialist – Bridges the gap between design and development by
rapidly prototyping gameplay mechanics, interactions, and features in-engine. This role is essentially a
game designer who can write enough code or use visual scripting to implement their ideas
directly, allowing for quick iteration. In XR projects, a Technical Designer might, for example, build a
VR interaction prototype using Unity’s XR Interaction Toolkit or script an AR gameplay demo to test
a concept, without needing a full engineering team. This career path aligns with the user's Unity
prototyping and modding experience – they enjoy hands-on creation of playable ideas – while not
requiring them to be a full software engineer. Think of it as a role for a designer who is technically
savvy with tools like Unity, Unreal Blueprints, C# scripting, etc., enabling them to turn design
documentation into functional proof-of-concept experiences.
22. Salary (2025 & Beyond): Technical Designers (sometimes called Technical Game Designers or
Prototype Engineers) are in demand at studios that value rapid experimentation – e.g. innovation
labs, VR startups, or any game studio with small agile teams. Salaries are comparable to game
designers, often skewing higher if the technical skills are strong. In the US, a mid-level Technical
Game Designer might earn around $80k–$120k, and seniors at large studios can hit $130k+. (For
reference, general VR game designer roles average ~$115k in the US 56 , and technical roles tend to
be at the upper end.) Some postings for “Technical Designer” in AAA list ranges in the $100–130k
area, especially in costly markets. In Europe, expect €45k–€75k for similar mid-level positions (with
outliers higher in Northern Europe). Because this role can overlap with some programming,
companies with complex projects value it and might offer higher compensation to attract designers
who can script. By 2030, as more studios adopt rapid prototyping (and as XR design paradigms
continue evolving, needing lots of experimentation), the role should remain well-paid. It’s plausible
that a highly experienced XR prototyping lead could earn $150k+ in the US, especially at big XR
companies or successful game firms. Additionally, there is some consulting potential – some
technical designers eventually become independent prototype specialists, though the user prefers
full-time roles.
23. Skills & Growth: This role doesn’t necessarily require advanced CS degree, but it does require selfsufficient development skills. The user should invest time in improving their Unity C# skills (or
Unreal Blueprint scripting) beyond “light” level – not to full engineer capacity, but enough to
comfortably implement gameplay logic, user input handling, and utilize SDKs (like SteamVR or
ARCore). Learning Unreal Engine’s Blueprint visual scripting is highly recommended (many XR
projects use Unreal for high-end VR; Blueprints would leverage the user’s non-coding strength with a
visual approach). Over 1–3 years, the user can build this skill by replicating simple game mechanics
and gradually tackling more complex interactions with the help of AI coding assistants. The portfolio
for a technical designer is the prototypes themselves: e.g. a small AR game built single-handedly or a
Unity XR demo where the user implemented custom interactions. Showing the source code or
Blueprint graphs (on GitHub or a personal site) is important to prove technical competence 57 . The
user’s QA background also helps – as they prototype, they can self-test and refine quality. Growthwise, this role can evolve into a Gameplay Engineer (if they deepen coding) or a Design Director

7

(using prototyping skills to lead vision). But it’s also a solid individual contributor path on its own,
often valued in small XR startups where employees wear multiple hats.
24. Industry Fit: Technical Designers are sought in game studios (especially those that iterate on
gameplay heavily – e.g. studios known for gameplay innovation or companies in pre-production on
new IPs). VR/AR startups or research labs (like an XR R&D lab inside a big company) love generalists
who can prototype new AR features or interaction concepts quickly. Even enterprise product teams
(e.g. an AR platform development team at a large tech firm) might hire someone to build UX
prototypes for user testing new features. Essentially, any environment where ideas need to be tested
in-engine rapidly is a fit. With XR being relatively new, many companies allocate time for
experimentation – a technical designer can lead those experiments. Because the user is open to
relocation, they could consider hotspots like Seattle or the Bay Area (big VR/AR companies and
game studios), or Austin, Montreal, Vancouver (game dev hubs with many studios). There is also a
trend of remote-friendly jobs for prototypers, since prototypes can often be built independently.
25. AI Augmentation vs. Replacement: Strongly Augmented (Low risk). This role benefits immensely
from AI assistance, turning a potential weakness (limited traditional programming skill) into a nonissue. AI code assistants (Copilot, ChatGPT) can help write Unity C# scripts or Unreal Blueprints
snippets from simple prompts, enabling the designer to implement features they envision without
getting stuck on syntax 58 22 . For example, the user can describe in pseudo-code what a VR
interaction should do, and let the AI suggest actual code, then tweak as needed – effectively pair
programming with AI. This drastically lowers the barrier to create complex prototypes solo. AI can
also auto-generate assets (via GPT-4 or stable diffusion) to fill in placeholder content in a prototype,
saving time (e.g. generating a quick 3D model or sound effect to use temporarily). Far from replacing
a technical designer, AI makes them more effective – a single designer can produce prototype
content that used to require a small team. To remain indispensable, the user should focus on the
creative and design side (what to build, why it’s fun or useful) and leverage AI for the grunt work of
how to build it. Since this role is inherently about implementing new ideas, AI can’t replace that
inventive spark; it can only assist in realization. One emerging trend to watch: procedural
generation tools that can create level layouts or game logic. A savvy technical designer will
incorporate these (e.g. use an AI tool to auto-generate a basic level, then iterate on it) rather than
feel threatened by them. In summary, being an AI-empowered prototyper will likely increase one’s
value. The role remains safe as long as the designer continues to guide AI with design insight – a
machine might generate content, but it won’t know which gameplay idea is worth pursuing without a
human’s creative decision.
26. Immersive UX Researcher (AR/VR User Research Specialist) – Studies user behaviors and
preferences in immersive tech to inform design improvements. This role is a specialized track focusing
on user research for XR products – perfect for someone with strong empathy and analytical skills
who might prefer the research side over hands-on design. The Immersive UX Researcher plans and
conducts studies like VR game usability tests, AR app user interviews, comfort & ergonomics
research (e.g. how different UI placements affect strain), etc. They turn findings into design
recommendations. This career aligns with the user’s strengths in communication (explaining ideas)
and QA testing, and it leverages an advanced degree like the M.S. in Interaction Design the user is
considering – which emphasizes research methods 59 60 . Importantly, it does not require heavy
coding or asset creation at all – it’s more about methodology and insight.
27. Salary (2025 & Outlook): UX Researchers are highly valued in tech, and those specializing in AR/VR
are no exception. In the U.S., a UX Researcher at a tech company averages around $90k–$130k, with

8

senior researchers in major firms (Google, Meta) making $150k–$180k or more (including bonuses)
61
62 . In fact, Google’s AR team explicitly prefers candidates with advanced degrees and offers
top-of-market pay for those roles 11 61 . As an example, a “Senior UX Researcher – AR” role could
be in the $140–$180k base range today, reflecting the niche expertise. Europe’s salaries are a bit
lower: perhaps €50k–€90k for UX researchers depending on country (UK might be £40–£70k range,
Western Europe up to ~€80k at large companies, with some outliers in Switzerland or Nordic
countries paying more). By 2030, as XR becomes mainstream, demand for researchers will grow to
ensure these new interfaces meet human needs. We may see more XR hardware companies and
studios building dedicated UX research teams. Salaries should keep pace with other tech roles, so an
experienced Immersive UX Researcher could be looking at $200k+ total compensation in top U.S.
firms by the 2030s. Moreover, the skills are transferable to any new tech domain, adding to longterm stability.
28. Education & Skills: Typically, these roles require at least a Master’s degree in a relevant field (HCI,
cognitive psychology, etc.) 11 63 – which the user is on track for with the UBalt M.S. Interaction
Design. Academic grounding in research methods is crucial (courses in statistics, experimental
design, etc. are directly applicable 64 65 ). The user should capitalize on UBalt’s user research
courses (IDIA 642 Applied UX Research, IDIA 742 Advanced User Research, etc.) which map directly
to this career 66 67 . Key skills include designing studies (formulating testable questions about an
XR experience), conducting them (running VR playtest sessions, eye-tracking studies, surveys), and
analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data. The portfolio for a researcher is more like a case
study repository: include research plans, examples of study deliverables (like a VR usability report
or an infographic of user comfort findings). If possible, publish or present a study (even if a class
project) – for instance, “Thesis: Evaluating User Navigation Patterns in AR HUDs” – this signals
thought leadership. Networking in the UX community (conferences like IEEE VR, CHI, or UXPA) can
also help demonstrate engagement.
29. Roles Unlocked: With this background, the user can pursue roles such as UX Researcher – AR/VR,
Human Factors Engineer (XR), or User Research Analyst at a game studio or XR product company.
Many big companies have dedicated researchers for their XR projects – e.g. Reality Labs at Meta
employs researchers to test ergonomics of Oculus interfaces, Microsoft has researchers for HoloLens
usage, gaming giants hire user researchers to run playtests on new titles. The UBalt program’s STEM
designation even aids here if the user wants to work in the US, giving up to 3 years OPT work
authorization which is attractive for employers 68 69 . Outside big tech, UX research
consultancies may start offering XR research services, where one could be the resident XR expert.
Also, academic or lab positions are an option (though those skew toward PhD level), but industry is
where the high-paying jobs lie. Notably, the program at UBalt instills a rigorous, evidence-based
approach to design 70 71 , exactly what companies like Google AR look for 11 . So this path is a
natural outcome of completing the master’s with a focus on XR.
30. AI and the Researcher: Augmentation (Low risk). AI is a boon for user researchers. While it cannot
replace the empathy and critical thinking a human brings, it can automate many tedious steps. For
instance, AI can transcribe and summarize interview recordings – a large language model can sift
hours of VR user interview data and highlight common sentiments 23 . AI analytics tools (Maze,
Hotjar with AI features) can automatically parse quantitative user data (click patterns, gaze
heatmaps) and flag significant results 23 . This allows the researcher to spend more time
interpreting why those results matter. The researcher can also use AI to generate test scenarios or
even virtual users: imagine simulating hundreds of users in a VR environment via AI to predict
potential issues – still an emerging tech, but plausible. Crucially, formulating the right research

9

questions and interpreting results in context are human tasks. Ethical considerations are also
paramount (AI might introduce bias in analysis if not guided). So the Immersive UX Researcher’s role
remains essential as the human in the loop who asks the right questions and ensures the user’s
voice is truly understood, not just crunched as data. If anything, AI makes them more effective
(analyzing more data in less time) and frees capacity to tackle complex, strategic research questions.
Embracing AI tools will be part of the skill set (the user should learn to use tools like Dovetail or
Atlas.ti with AI features for qualitative analysis, for example), but their expertise in experimental
design and empathy-driven insight keeps them firmly in demand. This role, focusing on human
behavior, is among the least likely to be automated – it’s about understanding humans, which by
definition is something we want a human to lead.

6 , systems designer estimates 45 , narrative designer averages 54 , etc.), as well as XR industry analyses
for regional differences (e.g. Europe XR roles ~€55–110k 8 ). Salaries are for full-time roles. Notably, XR
roles in US tech hubs can significantly exceed national averages (Meta’s AR/VR designers can total ~$190k–
$295k with bonuses) 72 . European salaries are generally lower, though cities like London can approach US
levels for top firms. AI replacement risk is assessed qualitatively – in all these roles, AI is more of an
enhancement tool than a full replacement in the foreseeable future.

2. Portfolio Project Ideas for Immersive Design
To break into these roles, the user should build a portfolio of XR projects that showcase interaction design,
gameplay mechanics, spatial UX, and narrative innovation. Below are some capstone-quality project ideas
tailored to the user’s interests (gameplay, spatial UI/UX, narrative) and suitable for a senior project or
master’s thesis. Each is designed to highlight creativity while also being AI-resilient (emphasizing design
and systems thinking). Importantly, when executing these, the user should document the process
extensively – employers want to see how you think and solve problems, not just the end result 13 14 .
- VR “Escape Room” Puzzle Game – Design a short VR puzzle adventure where the player physically
interacts with the environment to solve challenges. This project would highlight spatial
interaction design and narrative combined: for example, the room’s objects provide clues to a
story (immersive environmental storytelling). The user can demonstrate inventive mechanics
like grabbing, throwing, or manipulating objects via hand controllers in intuitive ways.
Portfolio emphasis: Show the UX considerations (e.g. how you placed visual cues so players
notice them in 360°, how you mitigated motion sickness with teleportation locomotion vs.
smooth movement). Also include a video playthrough to communicate the experience. If done
as a thesis, the user could incorporate user testing** – e.g. measure how long it takes users to
solve puzzles or if they found any interactions unintuitive, then iterate. This would impress both
game UX and XR design hiring managers. (Unity with the XR Interaction Toolkit could be used to
implement this; any required scripts can be aided by ChatGPT to handle object interactions.)
- AR Spatial UI Prototype – Build an AR application that tackles a real-world task with an innovative
3D interface. For instance, an AR Museum Tour Guide: when a user points a tablet or AR glasses
at an exhibit, a contextual 3D UI pops up around it, presenting information in an interactive
way (maybe a 3D timeline floating in space, or a miniature animation). This showcases
information architecture in AR and spatial UI design. The user can leverage their
communication/media background to create engaging content, and their design skills to
ensure the UI is legible and user-friendly in an AR context. Portfolio emphasis: Include your
design rationale for spatial layout (why info appears at certain positions or sizes in the user’s
view) and any usability testing (even if informal feedback from a few users on whether the AR
interface was easy to understand). This project aligns with roles in XR product design and
shows versatility beyond pure games. It’s also a chance to demonstrate familiarity with AR
development (using ARKit/ARCore or Unity’s AR Foundation). Bonus: incorporate a multimedia
storytelling element**, e.g. an AR character guide, to play to the user’s strengths and make the
project memorable.
- AI-Driven Interactive NPC in VR – Prototype a VR scenario featuring an NPC (non-player character)
with AI-generated dialogue and behavior. For example, create a simple VR “virtual friend” or questgiver character that the player can converse with via voice. Using a service like Inworld AI or
integrating an LLM (Large Language Model) for dialogue, the NPC can respond to player questions in
natural language. The user’s job as designer is to define the character’s personality, backstory,
and narrative role, and constrain the AI such that it stays in character and on plot. This project
would highlight narrative design and systems design together: you’re effectively building a
narrative system where an AI generates the moment-to-moment script. Portfolio emphasis: Explain
how you crafted the dialogue prompts and rules (e.g. “the NPC is a medieval blacksmith with
knowledge of a treasure, responds helpfully but won’t reveal the secret unless X condition”).

11

Document a few example conversations and how the NPC’s responses improved after iterative
prompt tuning – showing your “dialogue directing” skills 53 . This would directly appeal to immersive
narrative design roles and also demonstrate cutting-edge use of AI as a design tool, marking you as
an innovative candidate. (If voice interaction is implemented, tools like Microsoft Azure or Google’s
speech-to-text can handle player input, and ElevenLabs can output the NPC’s voice 53 .)
- VR Gameplay Mechanics Demo (“Physics Playground”) – Develop a small sandbox in VR that lets
players experiment with a unique game mechanic. For instance, “Telekinetic Powers Simulator”: the
player can pick up and throw objects using hand gestures or gaze, with targets and scoring to make
it game-like. This highlights the user’s gameplay systems ability – you’d design the rules (maybe
heavier objects do more damage, combo points for creative trick shots, etc.) and handle the tuning
of difficulty or responsiveness. Alternatively, it could be a VR sports mini-game (e.g. a futuristic VR
archery with gravity effects). Portfolio emphasis: Treat this as a mechanics design exercise – include
notes on how you balanced the scoring or difficulty, what iterations you did to make the mechanic
feel “fun” (e.g. adjusting physics parameters to get the throw just right). Show recordings of early vs.
later prototype to illustrate improvements. This kind of project resonates with gameplay designer/
system designer roles because it’s essentially creating and refining a core loop. Plus, it
demonstrates proficiency with Unity physics and interactions (which the user has experience in),
crucial for systems design in immersive environments. If AI is used, note how (perhaps using ML
Agents to test the scoring balance or using an AI to suggest tweaks – though optional, it could be
interesting to mention).
- UX Research Study on XR Interaction – For a more research-focused capstone: design and execute a
user study comparing two interaction techniques in VR or AR. For example, teleportation vs.
smooth locomotion in VR – measure which method yields better task performance or lower
discomfort. Or compare a hand-gesture interface vs. controller button interface for the same
task in AR. This project results in a research paper or detailed case study rather than a “game,” but
it’s extremely valuable for UX roles. Portfolio emphasis: Show the study design (hypotheses,
methodology), data collected (could be quantitative like time to complete a task, error rates, and
qualitative feedback on preference), and the conclusions/recommendations drawn (e.g. “For short
navigation tasks in small VR rooms, smooth locomotion was fine for 80% of users, but for longer
distances teleport proved significantly more comfortable – thus a hybrid approach is
recommended.”). This demonstrates mastery of UX research and the ability to apply it to XR, which is
a rare and impressive skillset 59 60 . It could directly flow from the UBalt master’s thesis, for
instance. Even for design-centric employers, including one rigorous research project shows you
bring evidence-based design to the table, a big plus. Such a project could be presented in job
interviews or even submitted to conferences, establishing the user as a thought leader in XR UX.
For each of these ideas, remember to show your working: initial concept art or mindmaps (which could be
generated with AI for moodboards 73 ), prototypes and iterations, and reflections on what you learned. A
“living portfolio” approach is ideal – include sketches, test results, even mistakes, to illustrate your creative
and problem-solving process 13 51 . Also consider publishing your projects on platforms like GitHub (for
code), Itch.io (for builds), or personal website blogs with video demos. This not only impresses employers
but also helps you practice explaining your work clearly.

12

3. Recommended 1–3 Year Skill Development Plan
To position for these future-proof roles, the user should embark on a focused skill-development journey
over the next few years. Below is a phase-wise plan (covering ~3 years) aligning with finishing the current
B.S., potentially completing the M.S., and gaining practical experience. The plan emphasizes mastering
industry-standard tools, expanding XR design expertise, integrating AI into the workflow, and strengthening
### UX research capabilities:
Year 1: Foundations & Portfolio Building (Final year of B.S. Game & Simulation, preparing for M.S.)
- Master Unity & Expand Engine Skills: Solidify advanced Unity skills beyond coursework. Specifically, dive
into the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit (for VR/AR controller and hand interactions) and practice building
small AR apps with AR Foundation. Start learning Unity’s Visual Scripting (Bolt) if not already, to
prototype without heavy coding. Simultaneously, begin familiarizing with Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints –
create a simple VR scene in Unreal to learn this alternative toolset. Unity is the user’s strength, but Unreal is
popular for high-end XR (learning Blueprints leverages the user’s comfort with visual scripting). By year’s
end, aim to have at least one portfolio piece in each engine (e.g. a Unity VR demo and a tiny Unreal
interactive scene).
- Enhance Light Programming Knowledge: Although the user isn’t pursuing a programmer role,
improving coding literacy will pay off. Focus on C# scripting in Unity (write or modify scripts for gameplay
mechanics). Use AI coding assistants to learn – for instance, write pseudocode and let GitHub Copilot fill in
the actual C# 20 22 , then study that code to understand it. Build a habit of troubleshooting with AI help
(e.g. ask ChatGPT to explain an error or optimize a snippet). This will both improve coding skill and
demonstrate the user’s ability to leverage AI – a valued meta-skill.
- Start Using AI in Design Workflow: Integrate generative AI into daily work to boost creativity and speed.
For example, use Midjourney or DALL·E to generate concept art for your game ideas 73 (like concept
images for the VR escape room project). Use ChatGPT to brainstorm game mechanics or narrative ideas
(e.g. “List 5 puzzle ideas for a VR escape room involving physics”). Experiment with tools like Galileo AI (UI
design from text) to see how it might create UI layouts, and Uizard to convert sketches to prototypes 20 .
By adopting these early, the user will become fluent in AI-assisted design, staying ahead of peers.
- Capstone Project Execution: Dedicate substantial effort to the undergraduate capstone or final project,
choosing one of the ideas from Section 2 (or a similar integrative project). Treat it as a prototype for the
career to come. If possible, incorporate an element of user testing and iteration in the project, and compile
a polished case study out of it. This project can then be the centerpiece of the portfolio when applying to
jobs or the UBalt M.S. program.
- Community Engagement: Start engaging with the XR and game dev community for learning and
networking. Join online forums or Discords for Unity XR development, follow prominent XR designers on
Twitter/LinkedIn, and if feasible, attend local meetups (e.g. an IGDA chapter event or an AR/VR Meetup in
your city). Community involvement will keep skills up-to-date and could lead to mentorship or collaboration
opportunities.
Year 2: Specialization & Graduate Education (First year of M.S. in Interaction Design & IA, or first year in
industry if not pursuing grad school immediately)
- Deepen UX Research & HCI Knowledge: Leverage graduate courses like Applied User Research (IDIA
642) and Humans, Computers, Cognition (IDIA 640) 66 74 to build a strong theoretical foundation in
human-centered design. Apply these learnings to XR – for instance, if a class project is to create a persona
and journey map for a mobile app, choose an XR app context to stand out. Take any opportunity to do
research on XR usability (perhaps via class assignments or a research assistant position). The goal is to

13

emerge not just as a practitioner but as a theoretically informed designer who can back design decisions
with research – this is a key trait of the “strategic immersive professional” 1 2 .
- Expand to Unreal Engine & Advanced Tools: By now, aim to be comfortable enough with Unreal to
implement designs in it. Try making a prototype using Unreal Engine’s VR Template or adding a custom
interaction via Blueprint. This will diversify the portfolio and make the user eligible for roles at Unreal
studios (many AAA game studios and simulation companies prefer Unreal). Also explore specialized XR
tools: e.g. Blender for quick 3D blocking (not to become an artist, but to be able to create or tweak simple
geometry for prototypes), or Figma with VR plugins for 2D/3D UX wireframing. This broadens the technical
repertoire without going deep into asset creation.
- Focus Your Portfolio and Personal Brand: As skills grow, begin to specialize your “brand”. Whether it’s
“XR UX Designer with game background” or “Gameplay Designer with UX research skills,” clarify this in your
LinkedIn, personal website, and how you talk about yourself. The research from earlier suggests avoiding
the vague “XR Designer” title and instead branding oneself in a more established role with XR specialization
75
76 . For example, update your resume to say “UX Designer (AR/VR)” or “Game Designer – Immersive
Systems,” whichever aligns with your focus, and highlight immersive tech in your summary. This strategy
helps in job searches since recruiters often look for known titles (UX Designer, Game Designer) but will be
excited by your XR niche.
- Networking and Conferences: Use the academic environment to network. Attend at least one major
conference or industry event (some offer student discounts): Game Developers Conference (GDC) for
game design, or Augmented World Expo (AWE) for AR/VR, or an HCI/UX conference like ACM CHI if
research-focused 77 78 . These events expose you to cutting-edge work and allow you to meet
professionals. Locally, if in Baltimore or East Coast, you can attend meetups in nearby tech hubs (e.g. IGDA
Baltimore, VR events in DC, or even make trips to NYC/Boston which have vibrant XR communities 79 80 ).
Networking can lead to mentorships or job leads; for example, a connection might alert you to an
upcoming immersive design role before it’s posted.
- Internship or Real Client Project: If doing the M.S., try to land an internship or a capstone project with
a real client in the XR domain by the summer of Year 2. Many grad programs (UBalt included) encourage
practical projects. Perhaps partner with a local museum for an AR app project, or intern at a game studio as
an associate UX designer. Real-world experience will solidify your skills and make you more marketable. If
an internship in XR is elusive, a general UX internship is still valuable; you can be the “one who knows VR” in
the team and likely steer some project in that direction.
Year 3: Transition to Industry & Leadership Skills (Post-graduation or early career)
- Land a Role and Refine On-the-Job: By this point, the user should be aiming to secure a full-time role in
one of the target career paths. Leverage the portfolio and network built to apply for jobs like “UX Designer
– AR/VR”, “Game UX Designer”, “Associate Technical Designer”, etc. Early career might involve a junior
position (e.g. Junior UX Designer at a game studio) – take it as a stepping stone. On the job, continue
developing skills by seeking out tasks that align with your desired path. For instance, if you’re a junior
designer at a game company, volunteer to work on any AR/VR or innovative project, or collaborate with the
systems design team to learn from them. If you’re in a UX role at a tech company, perhaps you can pilot an
XR usability study or champion an AR feature. Being proactive will help you build a niche internally.
- Leadership & Communication: As skills mature, focus on soft skills and leadership. Many high-paying
strategic roles require cross-disciplinary collaboration and even leading teams 81 82 . Practice
communicating design ideas clearly to non-designers – something the UBalt program likely trains through
group projects. If possible, lead a small team project (even a volunteer open-source XR project or a game
jam team) to develop management experience. Additionally, consider mentoring underclassmen or
volunteering in XR communities (for example, answer questions on an XR forum or do a talk at a meetup).

14

### Teaching others will solidify your knowledge and signal expertise.
- Continual Learning & Micro-Upgrades: The XR field will continue to evolve rapidly through 2030. Commit
to a habit of continuous learning. This could mean taking a new relevant micro-certification each year
(see Section 4 for suggestions) or self-learning a new technology. For instance, if haptic feedback devices
become big in VR, familiarize yourself with haptic design principles; if a new AR glasses SDK comes out, do a
weekend project with it. Keep an eye on AI advancements in design too – by 2027, new generative design
tools might emerge (maybe AI that can create 3D scenes from sketches). Be ready to learn and adopt these
to stay ahead. Essentially, treat Year 3 and beyond as an ongoing cycle: learn, apply at work, gather results,
update portfolio, repeat.
- Target Next-Level Roles: With a few years of experience, the user can start positioning for more senior
roles or very niche roles. For example, if they followed the UX path, after 2-3 years as a UX designer, they
could target Senior UX Designer (Spatial Computing) at a big company, or Product Designer – XR roles,
which come with higher pay. If on the game design path, after shipping a title as a junior designer, they
could angle for a Gameplay Systems Designer position (having the credibility of real game experience
now). Use the early career period to identify which of the 6 roles truly resonates day-to-day and then pursue
that specialization aggressively. Given the groundwork laid, the user should be an attractive candidate for
those strategic roles by this point.
Throughout this 1–3 year plan, one guiding principle: make AI your ally. The user should continuously
integrate new AI tools into their workflow – whether for brainstorming, prototyping, coding, art, or research
analysis. By doing so, they future-proof their career against automation and actually multiply their
productivity 83 38 . The end result after 3 years will be a professional who can confidently say: “I can design
an immersive experience end-to-end – from concept, through user research, to prototype – using the best of my
creative skills and AI assistance.” This profile is exactly what forward-looking employers will pay a premium
for.

4. Certifications & Micro-Credentials to Consider
While building experience is paramount, targeted certifications and short courses can provide structured
learning and credible signals of expertise. Below are recommended certifications and micro-credentials
that align with the user’s career goals in XR design, UX, and interactive systems. These can be pursued
alongside work/studies to bolster the resume:
- Unity Certified User: VR Developer – An entry-level certification from Unity Technologies focused
on VR application development 84 85 . Earning this demonstrates foundational proficiency in Unity
for VR, including knowledge of stereoscopic rendering, VR hardware basics, using the XR Interaction
Toolkit, and basic C# for VR 86 87 . Given the user’s Unity background, preparing for this exam will
organize their skills and fill any gaps (like understanding Unity’s XR plugins thoroughly). It’s a
tangible way to show employers “I know how to build in VR with Unity.” Unity certifications are wellrecognized in the industry 88 . After the User level, the user can aim for Unity Certified Associate:
### Game Developer to further validate general Unity skills 89 .
- Unreal Authorized Training or Courses – While not as formal as Unity’s program, taking an Unreal
Engine online course with certificate would be beneficial. Options include Unreal’s own online
learning badges or courses from Epic’s partners. For example, completing a course like “Unreal
Engine XR Development” on platforms like Coursera or Udemy (some are offered in partnership with
Epic) can yield a certificate. This shows you’re not Unity-exclusive. Additionally, Unreal Engine

15

Specialist certifications (Epic has an "Unreal Authorized Developer" test in the works) are worth
watching. Having both Unity and Unreal credentials will underline the user’s engine-agnostic
capability.
- AR/VR Development Nanodegree (Udacity) – Udacity offers a well-known AR/VR Developer
Nanodegree program 90 . It covers developing VR applications in Unity, AR apps, and even some
principles of 3D graphics. Completing it results in a Nanodegree certificate. This can be especially
useful if the user wants a structured curriculum to ensure they’ve covered all bases in XR dev
(including any gaps like 3D math or optimization techniques). It’s industry-recognized and often
updated with input from companies (like Oculus/Facebook was involved in early versions). The
projects from the Nanodegree could also double as portfolio pieces.
- Coursera “XR for Everybody” Specialization (University of Michigan) – A multi-course Coursera
specialization focusing on XR design and development fundamentals 91 92 . It includes courses on
UX design for XR, development with WebXR, Unity, etc. Earning the certificate from this program will
reinforce both the conceptual HCI side and the technical side of XR design. Notably, it has an honors
track with hands-on XR projects 93 . Coursera certificates (especially from a reputable university like
Michigan) add academic credibility to your profile, which pairs well with the UBalt master’s.
- Certified Usability Analyst (CUA) by HFI – Since the user is investing in UX research skills, another
angle is a user experience certification. Human Factors International’s CUA certification is globally
recognized in the UX field. It covers user-centered design principles, UX methods, and testing. While
not XR-specific, it would solidify the user’s credentials as a UX professional. Given the UBalt
coursework, the user might already have much of the knowledge to pass the CUA exam. Having
“CUA” after their name could help for roles that involve UX research or interaction design, signaling a
commitment to usability best practices.
- Nielsen Norman Group UX Certification – NN/g offers a UX Certification program where one takes
a series of training courses and passes exams. It allows specialization in areas like Interaction Design
or UX Research. This could be an alternative to HFI’s CUA. For example, the user could do NN/g’s
course on Emerging Patterns in AR/VR UX (if available) or more general ones. NN/g is highly
respected in UX circles, so this certification could be useful if the user leans heavily towards UX roles
(particularly UX research or UX design roles). It’s also something that can be attained relatively
quickly (over a few conferences or training sessions).
- Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF) Courses – IxDF provides affordable, online self-paced
courses on various UX topics, including AR/VR design. While their certificates aren’t as prestigious as
university or official ones, they still carry weight as evidence of continuous learning. For instance, the
user could take “UX Design for AR/VR” or “Human-Computer Interaction” courses on IxDF and get a
certificate of completion. These courses can fill specific knowledge gaps (say, if the user wants more
insight into spatial interaction patterns or accessible design in XR).
- Unity Micro-Credentials & Badges – Beyond the big Unity certs, Unity Learn platform offers
“Pathway” badges (e.g. Junior Programmer, Creative Core). Completing the Unity XR Pathway on
Unity Learn (if available) could yield a badge. Additionally, Unity sometimes has specialized
certifications (for instance, “Unity Certified Instructor” if the user ever wants to teach, or “Unity
Verified Expert” in particular areas). While not all of these apply now, the user should keep an eye on

16

Unity’s certification offerings, as they evolve with industry needs (e.g., a future “XR Interaction Design”
cert might appear).
- Meta Spark AR Certification – If the user is interested in AR development for social media (e.g.
Snapchat lenses, Instagram filters), Meta offers a certification for Spark AR (their AR effects
platform) 90 . This is a more niche skill, but it could be useful if the user wants a quick entry into
doing creative AR work (some designers freelance creating AR filters). It’s not directly tied to the
primary goal of immersive game design, but knowing Spark AR could be a fun supplement and show
familiarity with popular AR tools. Consider this optional, for breadth.
In choosing which certifications to pursue, the user should prioritize those that fill a gap or strengthen
credibility in their desired role. For example, if aiming for XR UX Designer, a combination of Unity VR
Developer cert (to prove technical skill) and a UX certification (to prove design knowledge) would be
persuasive. If aiming more at game systems design, then perhaps Unity cert plus Udacity Nanodegree
(showing end-to-end AR/VR dev capability) would be better, and a general UX cert is less critical. It’s not
necessary to collect many certifications; rather, pick a few that strategically signal the mix of skills –
technical, design, and research – that the user brings. Each cert attempt can also structure the learning
process (e.g. studying for the Unity exam will ensure you systematically cover VR development concepts 86
87 you might have missed).
Finally, beyond formal certs, consider participating in hackathons or design competitions (many issue
certificates or at least provide recognition). For instance, the MIT Reality Hack is an annual AR/VR
hackathon where just being a participant (and building a project in 48 hours) is a strong experience to talk
about. Similarly, game jams like the Global Game Jam can be used to practice rapid prototyping; these won’t
give a certificate, but they do provide accomplishments you can list (e.g. “Created a VR game in 48 hours at
Global Game Jam 2026”). These experiences, alongside formal micro-credentials, show both commitment
to learning and practical ability – a combination that employers love.

5. Strategic Analysis of the UBalt M.S. in Interaction Design & IA
The user is considering the University of Baltimore’s Master of Science in Interaction Design and
Information Architecture (IDIA). This program is a HCI/UX-focused graduate degree which can be a
powerful asset for an immersive career. Below we analyze how its curriculum maps to XR/game job skills
and what career outcomes it can realistically support in the immersive design field:
### Program Highlights & Alignment:
UBalt’s IDIA program is known for its strong user experience curriculum and is even ranked among top UX
design grad programs 94 95 . It’s a STEM-designated program (beneficial for work visas in the US) and
regarded as in “high demand” by industry 68 69 . The program combines elements of computer science,
cognitive psychology, design, and even has mentions of game design in its interdisciplinary approach 96
97 . For the user, who straddles creative design and games, this broad approach means they can tailor their
learning to immersive design contexts. Many courses won’t explicitly mention XR, but their content can be
applied to XR with the right focus. For example:
- IDIA 612 Interaction and Interface Design: Core UX design principles – mapping directly to
designing any interface, including 3D/UIs in XR. Skills from this course (like usability heuristics,
prototyping in Figma, etc.) are the foundation for XR UI design. The user can apply assignments to

17

AR/VR (e.g. instead of a mobile app interface, design a VR menu) to get specialized portfolio pieces
out of it.
- IDIA 630 Information Architecture: Teaches how to structure information and navigation. In XR,
“spatial” information architecture is an emerging challenge – how do you organize content in a 3D
space or across multiple realities? Understanding classic IA will help the user create clear navigation
flows in complex immersive experiences (like a VR game with menus, maps, inventory systems, etc.).
This maps to roles involving complex system design and UI (e.g. Game UX Designer who must
design both in-game HUD and menu navigation 26 27 ).
- IDIA 640 Humans, Computers and Cognition: Essentially an HCI psychology course, covering how
humans perceive and process information. This is extremely relevant to XR design – concepts like
visual perception, memory load, and motor response are critical when designing for VR/AR, where
issues like motion sickness or cognitive overload can make or break the experience 3 98 .
Knowledge from this course will directly inform things like comfortable field-of-view for UI,
appropriate pacing of interactive narratives (so as not to overwhelm players), and understanding
limitations of user attention in 360° space.
- IDIA 642 Applied User Research for UX: Perhaps the most directly career-boosting for UX roles, this
course trains how to plan and conduct user research. The user can use course projects to do XRspecific research (for instance, user testing of a VR prototype as mentioned in Section 2’s research
project idea). Mastery of these methods feeds into Immersive UX Researcher roles and also makes
the user a better designer (because they can validate and iterate designs systematically). Many XR
designers lack formal research training, so the user would have a competitive edge here 70 71 .
- Technical Elective (IDIA 619 Programming for UX Design): This elective can shore up the user’s
coding confidence in a user-centered way. It likely teaches some JavaScript or front-end coding to
create interactive prototypes. While web coding isn’t directly XR, the general programming concepts
and problem-solving will translate to any technical implementation (like Unity scripting). It’s a chance
to become more comfortable with code in a low-pressure, design-oriented context.
- Advanced Topics (IDIA 712 Advanced Interaction Design / IDIA 742 Advanced User Research):
These “topics” courses might vary by semester. The user should look out for any offering focused on
emerging tech – sometimes programs introduce a special topic on AR, VR, or Game Design if faculty
has interest. If such a course is available, it’s obviously a perfect fit. If not, the user could potentially
use an advanced course project to focus on XR. For example, in Advanced Interaction Design, choose
a project like designing a multimodal interface (which could be AR glasses + voice, for instance). In
Advanced User Research, do a project on researching user immersion or presence in VR.
- Electives like IDIA 614 Sequential Visualization and Analysis: This sounds like a course on
information design/storyboarding (possibly dealing with visual narratives or data visualization). If it
covers storytelling (“sequential visualization” might mean storyboarding or comic-like sequences),
the user could tie that to narrative design for games – e.g. storyboard a VR experience’s key scenes
as an assignment. This builds narrative communication skill, useful for roles where you pitch
storyboards of game cutscenes or UX flows.

18

- Game Design Connections: The program’s mission statement explicitly includes game design as
one of the interdisciplinary areas 96 . While there may not be a specific game design course in the
master’s, the presence of a Simulation and Game Design undergrad at UBalt and the mention in
the mission suggests potential collaboration or elective options. The user might be able to take one
of the game design courses from the undergraduate or integrate with the game lab if the university
has one. Alternatively, the user’s own game design expertise will complement the HCI coursework to
produce a unique skillset.
### Roles the M.S. Can Help Unlock:
The combination of an HCI graduate degree and the user’s game background is quite powerful. Here are
realistic role outcomes and how the UBalt M.S. contributes to each:
- XR UX Designer / Product Designer: The master’s provides the formal UX training that many who
came solely from game design lack. Courses in user research, interface design, and cognition mean
the user will be able to approach XR product design with a rigorous, user-centered approach. This is
exactly what companies like Google, Meta want for their AR/VR teams (they often list “M.S. in HCI or
similar preferred” for their UX roles) 11 63 . The STEM M.S. also gives credibility when applying
globally. So the user could land roles such as Interaction Designer – AR Applications, UX Designer
– Mixed Reality in tech companies or startups. The program’s emphasis on process will let the user
speak the language of UX in interviews (personas, wireflows, user testing), proving they can design
not just cool experiences but effective ones.
- Game UX Designer / User Researcher: For the gaming industry, a master’s is not a requirement,
but having one in UX sets the user apart. Increasingly, large studios and gaming firms are investing
in UX testing and research (Ubisoft, for example, has a whole UX lab). The user could be an attractive
hire for a Game UX Researcher position, where their degree-backed research skills are directly
applicable to testing games. Or as a Game UX Designer, the combination of game dev experience
and UX education means they can bridge between hardcore game designers and the needs of
players. The UBalt program specifically will give methods to systematically improve game usability
(which many self-taught game designers might miss). Thus, roles at places like EA’s UX team or
Bungie’s player research division could be within reach. Additionally, having a master’s might fasttrack the user to senior UX roles a bit quicker, as it often counts as 1-2 years of experience in the eyes
of employers.
- Immersive Interaction Designer (Enterprise Sector): Outside entertainment, many enterprise
sectors seek people who can design effective XR solutions for employees or customers – e.g. a VR
Training Designer at a Fortune 500 or an AR UX Specialist at an automotive company. These often
require understanding complex user requirements and a high bar for usability (since these apps
aren’t optional fun, but work tools). The master’s program’s focus on research and inclusive design
(e.g. considering diverse users, accessibility) is a boon here 99 100 . The user could leverage their
degree to get roles in MedTech (VR therapy interfaces), EdTech (educational AR app design), or
Gov/Defense simulations UX – fields where an advanced degree is respected and sometimes
expected.
- Design Technologist / Prototyper in UX Teams: Some big companies have roles called “Design
Prototyper” or “Creative Technologist” in their XR teams. These roles want someone who can quickly
mock up an experience for testing – requiring both design sense and tech skill. The user, post-

19

master’s, will have boosted their design credentials and (hopefully via personal work) tech skills.
Combined with their game dev undergrad, they’d be well-suited to be that glue person. UBalt’s
program, by integrating arts and tech perspectives 101 102 , inherently prepares one to be a
translator between design and development – a trait of those prototyper roles.
- UX Lead / Strategist (longer-term): The degree is also an investment in leadership skills. It instills a
more strategic outlook on design (“design with evidence, iterate systematically, consider broad user
contexts”). This sets the foundation for eventually moving into lead roles. While right after
graduation the user will be entry/mid-level, the knowledge gained could allow them to progress
faster to roles like Lead UX Designer or Product Design Manager for XR after some years of
experience. The program’s collaborative projects will have taught them to communicate with
multidisciplinary teams – crucial for leadership.
### UBalt Program Advantages for Immersive Path:
- The flexible curriculum allows for self-directed focus. The user can funnel each project or thesis toward
XR. For instance, the required Thesis/Project (6 credits) 103 104 can be chosen as an immersive design
topic (say, “Designing a Framework for Spatial UI in AR” or “Usability of VR for Remote Education”). A strong
thesis in an XR topic can directly lead to job opportunities (show it to companies, or even publish it). - The
program is offered online or on-campus, and even part-time, which could allow the user to work or intern
concurrently (gaining experience while studying). The online option with in-state tuition for anywhere
105 means the user can potentially take this while not uprooting immediately, or while doing remote work.
- UBalt’s connections: The site mentions “We can’t turn out graduates fast enough” 106 107 , implying strong
employer demand. The user should tap into the program’s network of alumni and industry partners.
Professors might have connections in the UX or game industry around Maryland/DC (which has companies
and government contractors doing simulation and training development). The user should seek
opportunities like the game incubator or design incubator if any (the text about NYC had a game
incubator at NYU; perhaps UBalt or nearby universities have similar initiatives to watch). - The STEM
designation is a big plus for the user’s global mobility – after graduation, they’d potentially have 3 years in
the US to work without needing a H1B visa immediately. This means they can target US companies
confidently (many of which value a master’s). It makes the investment more worthwhile because it
effectively opens a larger job market.
### Considerations/Caveats:
- The program is not exclusively focused on XR, so the user will need to be proactive in tailoring it. They
won’t automatically become an XR developer from it – that part they must supplement with their own
projects (which they are planning to do). In group projects, the user could volunteer to bring in AR/VR
elements, but peers may be more web/app focused. This is fine; it trains the user to explain XR concepts to
non-XR folks – a likely scenario in many jobs. - Certain very technical aspects (like 3D engine optimization,
advanced programming) are not taught there. But the user doesn’t want a hardcore programming role, so
that’s acceptable. It just means if they later did want something like Technical Artist, this degree alone
wouldn’t cover those skills – but as we determined, TA/Pipeline TD is not the user’s chosen path, so that’s
okay. - Financial and time investment: It’s 36 credits, roughly two years. Given the user’s career goals, this
seems justified as it significantly strengthens the “defensible, high-level expertise” that commands premium
value 68 69 . The user should use the time to build an amazing portfolio with the school’s resources.
Employers will care more about the portfolio + the master’s together than the degree alone.

20

### Course Mapping to Job Requirements (Quick Reference):
- Spatial UX Roles (XR Interaction Designer, Product Designer): Courses in Interaction Design (IDIA 612)
and Cognition (640) map to daily skills in designing intuitive spatial interfaces and understanding
user comfort 3 98 . User Research (642) ensures you can validate designs – essential for senior
roles.
- Game/Narrative Design Roles: The program doesn’t teach storytelling, but it teaches understanding
users and systematic design. The user can combine that with their own storytelling talent. Possibly
use electives (like Special Topics or even a free elective from another department if allowed) to cover
narrative or game writing. If not, the user may lean on prior experience for the narrative aspect and
use the degree to demonstrate they’re not just a “creative” but also analytical.
- Systems Design Roles: Not directly covered (no class on “game balance”), but the analytical mindset
from stats courses (IDIA 841 Statistics for UX, etc.) 108 64 and the program’s emphasis on process
can help in a systems design approach (e.g. using data to drive game design decisions). If the user
does a thesis, they could even focus on a systems topic like “algorithmic personalization in VR” to tie
in their interest in game systems with research.
- UX Researcher Roles: This is where UBalt shines. Multiple research method courses plus a thesis that
must include user research 104 109 is perfect training for an immersive UX researcher career. The
user would graduate having done significant research (which many practitioners learn on job
instead).
In essence, the UBalt M.S. will complement the user’s game design background with rigorous UX
methodology and a broader design perspective, creating a hybrid skillset ideal for strategic roles in
immersive design. The program’s content aligns especially well with roles emphasizing user experience,
interaction design, and research in XR – such as XR UX Designer, Immersive UX Researcher, or
Interaction Design Lead – roles that require not just making experiences, but making them usable and
delightful through a scientific design process. The user should capitalize on every XR-related angle during
the program (projects, thesis, maybe even suggesting an XR workshop if one isn’t there) to emerge with a
resume that clearly says: “I am a UX/HCI expert who specializes in immersive technology.” This unique
positioning is likely to unlock roles at the intersection of UX and XR that are resilient to automation and
highly valued.

6. Leveraging AI Tools as a Co-Pilot in Immersive Design
As AI continues to transform creative workflows, the user should actively harness AI as a “co-pilot” to
amplify their productivity and creativity in immersive design 83 38 . By integrating AI tools into various
stages of design and development, the user can prototype faster, test more thoroughly, and explore novel
ideas, all while focusing their human effort on the highest-level creative decisions. Below are specific
recommendations for using AI as a companion in key areas of immersive game and systems design:
- AI-Assisted Prototyping & Coding: Writing code or complex engine scripts can be a bottleneck for a
designer who isn’t a programming expert. Embrace AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or
OpenAI’s Codex within Unity/Unreal development. For example, when prototyping a mechanic in
Unity, the user can write a comment “// teleport player to target point with smooth fade” and let
Copilot generate the C# function. This speeds up implementation dramatically 20 22 . Similarly, in
Unreal, if unsure how to achieve something in Blueprint, the user can ask ChatGPT for the logic
steps. This turns the AI into a pair programmer who handles boilerplate and syntax, allowing the

21

user to iterate on gameplay or interaction ideas with less friction. Microsoft’s Sketch2Code and
other UI automation tools can even convert hand-drawn interface sketches into working UI
prototypes 20 110 – useful when designing HUDs or menus for XR. The key is to still review and
understand the AI-generated code to ensure it meets design intent, but by offloading grunt work to
AI, the user can focus on what the game does rather than wrestling with code for hours.
- Generative AI for Art & Assets (Concept and Placeholder): While the user won’t specialize in asset
creation, they can use AI to get quick visuals for prototypes. AI image generators like Midjourney,
DALL·E, or Stable Diffusion are excellent for creating concept art, textures, or environment ideas in
minutes 73 111 . For instance, if the user is designing a VR escape room, they can prompt an AI to
generate images of “a mysterious steampunk laboratory interior” as concept references, which can
guide the aesthetic and even be used as skyboxes or UI backgrounds in a pinch. If a narrative needs
character portraits or item icons, AI can produce those instantly. Additionally, tools are emerging for
3D asset generation – e.g. Polycam AI or Kaedim for turning images to 3D models – though these
often need cleanup. The user should utilize these to populate prototypes with decent-looking assets
without needing a 3D artist on the team. Caution: AI-generated 3D models often have issues (messy
topology, etc.) 112 113 , so use them as temporary placeholders to test an idea, and later replace with
optimized models if needed. This approach ensures that lack of artwork never slows down testing a
game concept.
- AI in Level Design & Procedural Generation: Designing levels or environments, especially for VR
where scale and spacing are crucial, can be accelerated with AI. The user can experiment with tools
like GPT-4 to generate level layout ideas in text form (e.g. “Describe a challenging VR puzzle room
with 3 interconnected chambers and a central mechanism”), then use that as a blueprint to build the
level. There are also AI-driven level design aids – for example, DungeonGPT (for text adventure
layouts) or research projects where AI generates map sketches. While these are experimental, the
user can keep an eye on their development. Even using an AI like ChatGPT to analyze an existing
level and suggest improvements (“I have a level where players often get lost after the second puzzle,
how can I improve navigation?”) can yield fresh ideas. For procedural mechanics, AI can be used to
tweak parameters: the user could set up a simulation of a game system (like an in-game economy or
combat scenario) and use a simple machine learning model to find parameters that meet a certain
goal (e.g. balance win rates). This is more advanced, but even without ML, just using AI to run batch
simulations via scripts and analyzing output can find exploits or imbalances faster than manual
testing. In Unity, one could integrate an AI agent (using ML-Agents toolkit) to play through a level
repeatedly to test difficulty – essentially a supercharged playtester that runs 1000 playthroughs
overnight. The AI might discover that a certain strategy always wins (alerting you to rebalance) or
that part of the level is never visited (indicating a design flaw). This kind of AI-driven playtesting will
become increasingly common and the user should be ready to leverage it for systems tuning.
- Narrative Design & Dialogue Generation: The user can use Large Language Models (LLMs) to
assist in narrative content. For branching storylines, tools like Twine + GPT integration can generate
dialogue options or flavor text variations to keep content fresh. The user could, for example, use
ChatGPT to produce 10 different responses an NPC might give to a player’s question, then choose
the best or mix them. More sophisticated is using AI in the final experience: as noted, Inworld AI can
power NPC dialogue live 53 . The designer’s job becomes writing character profiles and dialogue
style guides (prompts) for the AI rather than every line. The user should practice this prompt
engineering: given their storytelling skills, they can craft nuanced prompts that yield high-quality,

22

in-character lines from the AI. They effectively become the editor/director of an AI writer’s work 114
115 . Additionally, AI can generate lore or item descriptions en masse, freeing the designer to focus
on core plot. One must be careful to maintain narrative coherence – thus, the user could also employ
AI to check consistency (e.g. ask the AI to verify if a new piece of lore contradicts earlier ones, using
the world info provided). In sum, AI can serve as a junior writer under the narrative designer’s
supervision, speeding up content creation while the human ensures quality and consistency.
- Automated UX Testing & Analytics: For UX research in XR, AI can crunch data far faster. The user
can use voice analysis AI on playtest session recordings to gauge sentiment (was the player
frustrated or delighted at each moment?). Computer vision AI could watch a video of a playtester in
VR and automatically log events (like “player looked confused between time 2:10 and 2:30”). These
are emerging capabilities – one concrete current tool is using ChatGPT to summarize survey
responses from players or playtesters 23 . Instead of manually coding qualitative feedback, the user
can prompt AI: “Summarize the main complaints players had about the new inventory UI.” This yields
quick insights, which the researcher then validates and uses. Another area is AI-guided design
critique: one could describe a design to an AI and ask for possible usability issues (ChatGPT trained
on UX heuristics might, for example, point out “In VR, placing UI at the edges might cause users to
twist uncomfortably”). While not always perfect, it’s like having a rubber duck that talks back with
some knowledge – it might surface considerations the designer hadn’t thought of. Overall, by
offloading analysis to AI, the user can iterate faster and base decisions on larger data sets than
would be feasible manually.
- AI for Personal Productivity & Learning: Outside of direct project work, the user should leverage
AI as a continuous learning and productivity tool. For instance, use ChatGPT as a tutor: if a new API
or math concept is confusing, ask it for clarification or examples. Use it to generate documentation
or cheat-sheets (e.g. “Explain the key differences between designing for AR vs VR in bullet points” – a
quick refresher that could even be used when evangelizing XR design to colleagues). When
preparing presentations or pitches (which the user will likely do as they progress to lead roles), AI
can help draft the narrative or create illustrative analogies. Essentially, treat AI as part of the
personal toolkit available 24/7 for brainstorming, explaining, and even time management (there are
prompt-based tools to help schedule tasks or break down complex goals).
Ethical and Creative Control: It’s worth noting that while using AI, the user must maintain ethical
standards and creative control. They should be aware of issues like copyright (don’t unknowingly ship AIgenerated art that might infringe on someone’s style), data privacy (especially in user research – if feeding
user data to AI, ensure it’s anonymized), and representation (AI can inherit biases, so filter AI outputs for
any biased or inappropriate content). By staying as the “human in the loop,” the user ensures that AI
augmentation remains a tool for good, not a source of errors or ethical pitfalls 116 117 .
In conclusion, by weaving AI into prototyping, design, testing, and storytelling, the user can achieve far
more in less time – a critical advantage in a fast-moving field. AI will handle the heavy lifting (number
crunching, brute-force generation, repetitive tweaks) and the user will focus on the creative vision, player
experience, and strategic decisions. This approach aligns perfectly with the notion in the research that the
“strategic immersive professional” is one who masters AI rather than gets replaced by it 118 119 . The user
will effectively have an army of tireless assistants (in the form of AI tools) at their disposal, allowing them to
punch above their weight, take on ambitious projects, and continually innovate in the realm of immersive
game and XR design.
