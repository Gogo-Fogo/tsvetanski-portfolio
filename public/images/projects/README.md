# Project Images

Store project-specific media in subfolders named by slug:

- `public/images/projects/<project-slug>/...`

## Naming

- Use lowercase `kebab-case`.
- Prefer descriptive names such as:
  - `<project-slug>-banner.png`
  - `<project-slug>-dev-01.jpg`
  - `<project-slug>-systems-debug.png`

## Purpose

- Keep `public/images/` root focused on shared or legacy top-level assets.
- Keep per-project assets grouped for easier maintenance and AI navigation.
