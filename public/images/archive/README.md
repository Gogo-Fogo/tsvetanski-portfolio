# Image Archive

This folder stores raw or non-production visual artifacts (for example web-capture dumps).

## Guidance

- Do not use these assets directly in project pages unless intentionally restored.
- Prefer curated assets from `public/images/` or `public/images/projects/<project-slug>/`.
- AI tools should treat this folder as low priority.
