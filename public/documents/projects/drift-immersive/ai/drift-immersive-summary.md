# Drift Immersive - AI Summary

## One-line summary
VR cockpit driving prototype focused on drift handling, immersive controls, and comfort-aware camera behavior.

## Core systems
- Physics-driven vehicle movement with drift tuning.
- Interactive cockpit elements (steering and speed feedback).
- VR interaction flow with camera decoupling and jitter reduction.

## My contribution
- Implemented and tuned movement/drift logic.
- Built and debugged cockpit interaction systems.
- Documented architecture, UI behavior, and code quality.

## Technical highlights
- Camera stabilization and reduced rotational jitter.
- Speed normalization pipeline for consistent gauge behavior.
- Iterative debugging workflow for steering/instrument synchronization.
