# Fallout Level Design - AI Summary

## One-line summary
Team-based Fallout 4 Creation Kit expansion where I joined midstream to build interior content and stabilize merged level performance.

## My role
- Built the third-floor interior and room variants.
- Fixed merge-impact issues (door links, room bounds, portals, and lighting).
- Focused on optimization and scene reliability in the shared final build.

## Problems solved
- Duplicate/conflicting data during multi-person merges.
- Severe visual corruption tied to bounds/portal conflicts.
- Performance pressure from dense interior populations and lighting.

## Workflow/tools
- Fallout 4 Creation Kit, Blender, NifSkope, B.A.E.
- Load doors + XMarkerHeading for cell continuity.
- Fast test iteration via `coc` and `tgm`.

## Outcome
- Stable merged level with clearer traversal, fewer visual failures, and improved runtime behavior.
