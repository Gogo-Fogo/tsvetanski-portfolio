## UI Snapshot Rule (Codex)
- For any visual layout change in the graph/about UI, run `node tmp/capture-graph.js`.
- Inspect the relevant screenshots in `tmp/graph-shots/` with `view_image` before finishing.
- If overlap, clipping, or collisions remain, iterate offsets and rerun snapshots until clean.
- In status/final notes, explicitly state that snapshot verification was performed.
